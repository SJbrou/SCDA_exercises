These are my resources for the Supply Chain Data Analytics course. I like ordering these so I can order my thoughts. Hopefully you'll find in them as well

The site is hosted on github pages and written and build using Rstudio and [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/books). You can always reach out to me if you want to chat about hosting your own sites on github. I'm available.
